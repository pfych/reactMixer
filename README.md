# React Mixer
This program ***DOES NOT WORK*** how I intend it to in it's current condition   
The program as of now is **extremely** messy and spaghetti as I am currently experimenting to see
if this is even possible at all. There are lots of un-used functions and useless imports, 
these ***will*** be cleaned up when I get the basics working.

## To-do list (in order of importance):

- [X] Create a new virtual sink
- [X] Delete created virtual sinks in current session
- [ ] Delete all created virtual sinks
- [ ] Automatically forward App to sink
- [ ] Refactor and clean up
- [ ] Create a nice UI

### Whats laid out right now in the code:
- Create virtual sinks
- Delete sinks created in current session
- Forward application to sink
- Basic UI

### Whats working:
- Create virtual sinks
- Delete sinks created in current session
- Basic UI

### Known Bugs:
- The Application attempts to forward an application to a sink via its *OLD* index number
